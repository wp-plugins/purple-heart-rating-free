== Description ==

**Purple Heart Rating Plugin for Wordpress**

This cool and customizable rating plugin is the 'new kid on the blog' and was created by online marketers for online marketers and with them in mind. We at <a href=\"http://wp-buddy.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"WP Buddy - your specialist for Wordpress Plugins\">WP Buddy</a> wanted to create something that 'scratches our own itch', meaning: a rating plugin that

*   is easy to set up,
*   makes it easy for the website visitors to rate and also invites them to comment,
*   is customizable to your own gusto, and
*   leaves away any unnecessary gizmos.

There is a **free and a premium version** for this plugin. While the free version will as well help to create these much wanted stars in the search results (through the implementation of schema.org micro data), naturally the premium version offers you a nice range of more useful key features. To see a comparison of the free and premium version of Purple Heart Rating Plugin, see here: <a href=\"http://wp-buddy.com/heartrating-wordpress\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Free and Premium Version of Purple Heart Rating Plugin\">http://wp-buddy.com/heartrating-wordpress</a>

**FEATURES & BENEFITS**

(where marked with * the feature is only available in the premium version)

*   *Rating of articles, pages, custom posts, products, images*: no matter what you want to have rated, your readers can rate it and this way create some much needed <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">social proof</span>
*   *stars in the search results*: you can enhance your visibilty and your trust by offering your website visitors a chance to rate your content
*   *customize*: nobody is alike, therefore you can adjust the color, size etc of the graphic-user interface and give it your personal flavor (the premium version also contains different icons to choose from)
*   *feedback option*:* based on the latest Wikipedia feedback option this feature invites your website visitors after rating in a discrete way to also send you feedback about the site so your offerings get better and better
*   *import existing ratings from GD Star Rating*: this allows you to keep all your existing GD Star Rating data by clicking only one button!
*   Top-10 Widget for your sidebar*: implement this widget and your website visitors will see which articles/products/... have been rated the most by other website visitors
*   Plugin shortcode*: by using the shortcode [purple\_heart\_rating] you can place the plugin practically anywhere on any page, rather than just on the top or bottom
*   Rating of comments*: allows your website visitors to give a heart to comments from others
*   Sorting of comments based on rating*: The best-rated comments will move up so that they can be seen immediately by others, adding to the value of the conversation
*   *Support within 48 hours**: Issues can always appear in the case of plugins, since there might be a conflict with other plugins or with the used theme; we'll be here when needed (note: please understand that we do not offer support for the free version but you are welcome to inform us about technical bugs related to the Purple Heart Rating Plugin, of course)

You are not convinced that stars in the search results can create trust? Don't take our word for it, but Google's! Google says that Rich Snippets (where the stars are created) are highly wanted: "We look forward to seeing structured markup continue to grow on the web, powering richer search results and new kinds of applications." (see ful article on <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.de/2011/06/introducing-schemaorg-search-engines.html\" target=\"_self\">Google's blog</a>)
